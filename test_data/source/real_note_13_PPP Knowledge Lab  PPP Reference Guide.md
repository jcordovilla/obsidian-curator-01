There is no single, internationally accepted definition of _Public-Private Partnership_. This _Reference Guide_ takes a broad view of what a PPP is, defining it as:

_A long-term contract between a private party and a government entity, for providing a public asset or service, in which the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility and remuneration is linked to performance._

This definition

* Encompasses PPPs that provide for both new and existing assets and related services;

* Includes PPPs in which the private party is paid entirely by service users, and those in which a government agency makes some or all payments;
* Encompasses contracts in many sectors and for many services, provided there is a public interest in the provision of these services and the project involves long-life assets linked to the long term nature of the PPP contract.

The project functions transferred to the private party—such as design, construction, financing, operations, and maintenance—may vary from contract to contract, but in all cases the private party is accountable for project performance and bears significant risk and management responsibility. PPP contracts typically allocate each risk to the party that can best manage and handle it—risk transfer to the private party is not a goal, but is instrumental for full transfer of management responsibility and for the alignment of private interests with the public interest. [What is a PPP: Defining "Public-Private Partnership"](https://pppknowledgelab.org/guide/sections/3-what-is-a-ppp-defining-public-private-partnership) provides more information on the range of contract types that constitute PPPs under this definition and the different nomenclature used to describe them.

Throughout this _Reference Guide_, the term “infrastructure” is used to cover the range of sectors and services for which PPPs are used. In this context, “infrastructure” encompasses economic, social, and government infrastructure—that is, the “basic physical and organizational structures” needed to make economic, social, and government activity possible (using the Oxford English Dictionary definition). [How PPPs Are Used: Sectors and Services](https://pppknowledgelab.org/guide/sections/8-how-ppps-are-used-sectors-and-services) further describes the range of sectors and services for which PPPs are used.

At a minimum, a PPP will include a long-term commitment to provide infrastructure services—this implies the design and construction of infrastructure, or the renewal of existing assets, and the provision of long-term asset-maintenance. Most PPPs include additional services, including the full operation of the infrastructure when the private operator is able to commit to service quality and performance, and the procuring authority is able to define that same quality and performance. These additional services should also take place over the long term.

Practitioners can, if their projects are well-selected and their PPPs carefully structured, design and implement projects that optimize cost effectiveness and social well-being by aligning private partner profit objectives with public sector service objectives that support the public interest.

A substantial body of knowledge on Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) has been generated across the world by a broad spectrum of practitioners from government, the private sector, international development institutions, academia, and expert advisors. This _Reference Guide_ helps readers navigate this body of knowledge. It introduces key topics on PPP, sets out options, and directs readers to examples and references where they can learn more.

A growing number of governments are interested in partnering with the private sector to provide public infrastructure assets and services. This _Reference Guide_ is meant to assist them. It aims to help government officials and other interested parties in answering these questions:

* What are PPPs, and why use them?

* What kind of policy, legal, and institutional framework is need to ensure PPPs achieve their stated objectives efficiently and effectively?
* What is the process for developing and implementing a PPP project?

The _Reference Guide_ attempts to provide the most relevant examples, references and resources to help readers inform themselves on key PPP topics. It is not a toolkit or a step-by-step guidebook; nor should readers expect to find a presentation of the status of PPPs in any given country or sector here. Those who wish to educate themselves on PPPs more thoroughly will find the **APMG** **PPP Certification Guide** ([APMG 2016](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/4495/download)) a useful resource. Examples of well-formulated PPP manuals and toolkits are the **South Africa PPP Manual** ([ZA 2004a](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/2255/download)), the **Caribbean PPP Toolkit** ([Caribbean 2017](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/4496/download)), and the World Bank sectoral toolkits ([WB 2016f](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/4163/download))—for instance, the toolkit on roadways ([WB 2009a](https://ppiaf.org/d/2066/download)).

# What is in the Reference Guide

The _Reference Guide_ is divided into three modules:

* **Module 1: PPP Basics—What and Why?** Provides an overview of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)—what they are, how they are used to provide infrastructure assets and services, their benefits, and their pitfalls

* **Module 2: Establishing the PPP Framework.** Describes the elements of a sound legal and institutional PPP framework—that is, the policy, processes, institutions, and rules that together define how PPPs will be identified and implemented, and that promote good governance of PPP programs
* **Module 3: Implementing PPP Projects.** Provides guidance on each stage of developing and implementing a PPP project—from initially identifying candidate projects to managing PPP contracts through the project lifetime

Each module begins with an introduction, providing an overall framework for the module's content, and listing any helpful overview references. The modules are divided into sections, each covering a different topic.

# Who Should Use the Reference Guide

This _Reference Guide_ targets government officials who wish to improve their knowledge of PPPs. Other parties, including civil society organizations, private sector participants, universities, or other readers will find different parts of this _Reference Guide_ useful at different times. As noted previously, the _Reference_ _Guide_ is part synthesis and part bibliography. As such, it may be useful for both the newcomer to the PPP area looking for a structured introduction to key PPP topics, and the expert who may find additional references in some specific area.

	PPPs have been used in a wide range of sectors to procure different kinds of assets and services. In all cases, the PPP project constitutes or contributes to the provision of public assets or services; and it involves long-life assets.
	
	The definition of _public services_ may vary across countries, and over time. The material presented in this _Reference Guide_ is neutral to this definition; considering as a _public service_ any service that the government considers its responsibility to provide or ensure is provided. The focus on long-term assets highlights the long-term nature of a PPP contract. PPPs generally involve fixed assets but projects may also include related long-life assets that are purpose or site-specific, such as train rolling stock. [PPPs by Sector—Examples and Resources](https://pppknowledgelab.org/guide/sections/8-how-ppps-are-used-sectors-and-services#table-4) provides a few examples of the types of assets and services that can be procured by PPPs together with some references providing more in-depth analysis on the range of worldwide experiences with PPPs.
	
	Some countries focus their use of PPPs on certain sectors only, as described in [PPP Policy](https://pppknowledgelab.org/guide/sections/21-ppp-policy). The rationale for such narrow focus can include the desire to support the government’s investment priorities; to improve service delivery; or give precedence to sectors in which PPPs are expected to be most successful.
	
	Conversely, some countries define certain sectors or services within sectors, for which PPPs may not be used. These are sometimes called _core services_—that is, services that should be provided exclusively by government. The definition of core services varies across countries, depending on local preferences and perceptions. For example, in the healthcare sector in the United Kingdom, PPPs have been used to construct hospitals and provide ancillary services such as maintenance, but the core medical services remain publicly-run ([McKee et al. 2006](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/4311/download)). On the other hand, in a PPP hospital project in Lesotho, the private operator provided the full range of healthcare services ([IFC 2011](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/1946/download)).
	
	Useful resources providing cross-sector overviews of PPP experience in developing countries include:
	
	* **Farquharson et al's** book on PPPs in emerging markets ([Farquharson et al. 2011](https://pppknowledgelab.org/guide/sections/1-introduction#js-document-id-16)) provides a broad range of case studies. These include a greenfield hospital in Mexico, an upgraded hospital in South Africa, a water concession in the Philippines, a water and electricity services concession in Gabon, a new metro line in Sao Paulo, Brazil, an airport expansion in Jordan, and a review of the PPP program in national highways in India.
	
* The **Uongozi Institute’s** case studies on PPPs in Sub-Saharan Africa ([Yescombe 2017](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/4498/download)) present projects in the water, road, rail, energy, health, and accommodation sectors.

* The **Caribbean PPP Toolkit** ([Caribbean 2017](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/4496/download)) includes references to projects in a broad range of sectors, utilizing various PPP models.
* **Yong's chapter on PPPs in Commonwealth countries** ([Yong 2010](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/2227/download), 87–104) includes 11 case studies in the water, transport, power, and health sectors in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.
* A **paper by Farlam on PPP experience in Africa** ([Farlam 2005](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/2237/download)) presents the lessons learnt from eight PPP projects in the transport, prisons, telecommunications, water, power, and tourism sectors.
* The **World Bank's review of lessons learned from Output-Based Aid projects** ([Mumssen et al. 2010](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/2238/download)) summarizes the experience accumulated to date from infrastructure projects involving private sector participation and output based aid provisions—including PPPs —in the communications, roads, energy, water, health, and education sectors.
* The **Asian Development Bank's** **scoping study on irrigation and drainage** ([Varma et al. 2013](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/2239/download)) identifies the areas where private sector participation can be envisaged in consonance with India's policy framework.
* The **International Finance Corporation (IFC)’s _Handshake_ series** ([WB 2015c](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/4490/download)) comprises quarterly publications, each focusing on the use of PPPs in a different sector or context.
* The **PPIAF website** ([PPIAF-Resources](https://ppiaf.org/d/4491/download)) includes reviews of PPP projects in several developing countries. For more information on how PPPs have been used in developed markets, see the **European Investment Bank's European PPP reports** ([DLA Piper 2009](https://pppknowledgelab.org/d/2242/download)), which provide a detailed review of country experience and list of PPP projects throughout the region.
