La escalada de los fondos de inversión y de pensiones y de grupos industriales extranjeros en las autopistas y autovías españolas se ha multiplicado en los últimos años. Así, de las 11 concesiones de vías de peaje del Estado cedidas al sector privado, 10 ya están gestionadas por firmas foráneas o por empresas que, aun radicadas en España, están bajo el control de capital extranjero. En el caso de las autopistas de pago cuya titularidad es de comunidades autónomas, el dominio es total: siete de siete. https://www.eleconomista.es/empresas-finanzas/noticias/10562433/05/20/El-capital-extranjero-ya-contr ola-el-96-de-las-autopistas-privatizadas.html Un buen diseño del Toll Collect aportaría dinero para inversión y conservación, tenemos empresas españolas con tecnología adecuada y los beneficios redundarían en las arcas públicas, las infraestructuras y no en fondos extranjeros. Eso sí no hay que enfadar a la Corte Europea, discriminando entre conductores nacionales y extranjeros. Toll Collect nació privada y para gestionar tráfico pesado de camiones "On September 1, 2018 the Federal Republic of Germany acquired shares in Toll Collect GmbH" , con el objetivo de un peaje generalizado en Alemania incluyendo vehículos ligeros, pero subvencionando a los nacionales en sus declaraciones de impuestos. As former transport minister eyes stumbled into the toll debacle More and more mistakes by the ex transport minister are becoming public. Even objections from other ministries did not deter him from plans for the CSU prestige project. The ministry's risk assessment proved to be a disaster Despite all of these warnings of being shipwrecked, the Department of Transportation rated the likelihood that the project might burst at just 15 percent. A misjudgment because the European Court of Justice collected the levy in the middle of last year because it discriminated against foreigners. "Sound technical objections from experts in the Chancellery, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance as well as from the scientific service of the Bundestag have been ignored," criticized the transport spokesman for the Greens, Stephan Kühn, for the ignorance of the CSU leadership. "Instead, the Ministry of Transport always trusted the lonely legal opinion of the house and court appraiser Hillgruber", Kühn complained in an interview with our editorial team. This could cost taxpayers several hundred million euros, which the toll operators will demand in compensation. Dobrindt's successor Scheuer did not wait for the verdict Dobrindt's successor Andreas Scheuer (CSU) had concluded the toll contracts with the two companies Kapsch and Eventim, although the judgment of the European judges was still pending. As has now become known, Scheuer's cell phone data and close executives for the period before February 2019 have been deleted. The opposition wanted to see them for processing the toll debacle. "It gives the impression that the Ministry of Transport has acted systematically here," complained Green Transport expert Kühn. https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/Wie-Dobrindt-sehenden-Auges-ins-Maut-Debakel-taumelte-i d57039511.html Georg Kapsch, Austrian businessman, was supposed to operate the car toll - now he is demanding compensation from the German state. Now he is talking about his argument for the first time. ....Your company was hit hard by the end of the German car toll in 2019, which was decided by the European Court of Justice . The Kapsch AG and Eventim should the owner of the car toll to be and are now demanding compensation . Kapsch : It would have been my first really big business in Germany. We have been operating as a company for many years in the USA , South America, Africa, Australia and in many European countries, we operate toll systems. The German project would have been a very nice prestige project for us and would have run for more than ten years. But you have to take note that it didn't happen. Now it is as it is and we will see how it goes on. Arbitration proceedings are now to be held on compensation. How do you see that? Kapsch : We will adhere to everything that is contractually agreed. Was the competitive situation particularly good for you when it came to the tender? Kapsch : I don't know because I don't know what the others have offered. I only know my partner CTS Eventim and me. And what ultimately decided Mr. Scheuer, I had no influence on. I can't tell you more about that. Have you tried to prevent Austria's lawsuit against the toll? Kapsch : I had a dispute with the then Minister of Transport Jörg Leichtfried. I told him that I don't think it would be a good idea for Austria to sue. I said, what does that bring us apart from trouble with the neighbors? Because I saw the danger that we might fly out of the bidding process later - at that time we had not even made an offer. The city toll is now a topic of discussion in cities like Munich and Hamburg . Is this a new business perspective with Germany ? Kapsch : We will certainly take part in the tenders. We operate toll systems on the Golden Gate Bridge and the Öresund Bridge. So far, there are not many cities that have introduced city tolls. But I am convinced that it is the future for many. Kapsch plans feedback circles between traffic lights and vehicles What could city toll look like? Kapsch : It depends on the ideas of individual cities. For example, when entering a city, cars are either tolled or punished for not having the right to enter. Or tolls are combined with traffic management systems. In the future, traffic light control will be important, with information from traffic lights getting into the vehicles - there will be a feedback circle between traffic light control and the vehicle. The point is that there is as little braking and acceleration as possible. Route recommendations can also be given. A city could use intelligent algorithms to keep through traffic away from residential areas, for example. https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/Unternehmer-Georg-Kapsch-Die-Maut-waere-ein-grosses-Ges chaeft-gewesen-id56836161.html En Abril 2016 Kapsch TrafficCom cierra la adquisición de la división de Transporte de Schneider Electric. Se preparaba para los acontecimientos de 2017 Se espera que la división de Schneider Electric aporte a Kapsch TrafficCom Group una facturación aproximada de 125 millones de euros y un EBIT ligeramente positivo. Kapsch integrará a cerca de 900 empleados de Schneider en su plantilla global, que actualmente asciende a cerca de 3.500 personas. https://www.finanzas.com/comunicados-de-empresa/kapsch-trafficcom-cierra-la-adquisicion-de-la-divisi on-de-transporte-de-schneider-electric\_13380548\_102.html Operating companies demand 560 million repayment In autumn 2018, Scheuer wanted to levy the toll levy on private operators, but several applicant companies dropped out. The ministry received only one final offer from a consortium of Kapsch and Eventim companies. But this consortium demanded a billion euros more than the minister had been granted by the Bundestag. But then the Ministry and Kapsch / Eventim negotiated a contract until the end of 2018 that became one billion cheaper and thus fit. The Federal Audit Office has determined that these renegotiations were contrary to procurement law. Also because the previously bidders were not informed that the conditions set by the ministry for the toll collection had been changed during the talks with Kapsch / Eventim. https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article207959541/Maut-Debakel-Zeugen-wahrscheinlich-massiv-u nter-Druck-gesetzt.html Saludos, JCB
