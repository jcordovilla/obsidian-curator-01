## Curator Summary

**PUBLICATION ABSTRACT**

The planet is currently on an unsustainable path, requiring transparency, inclusion, and accountability to change its trajectory. A shift in the global political economy of environmental data is needed to harness public and private sector efforts to generate high-quality data and insights as a global public good while avoiding technology and data monopolies. A global digital ecosystem for the environment has the potential to put us on a path toward a sustainable future, requiring action from citizens, governments, the private sector, and intergovernmental organizations.

**TECHNICAL CONTRIBUTIONS**

1. The discussion paper outlines the status quo of environmental data challenges.
2. It translates various priorities into a consolidated vision statement and set of opportunities, risks, and governance challenges.
3. A digital ecosystem for the environment is proposed as a global public good governed through an international process backed by the UN.

**RESEARCH APPLICATIONS**

The proposed digital ecosystem aims to harness public and private sector efforts to generate high-quality data and insights. It requires action from citizens, governments, the private sector, and intergovernmental organizations. The UN can play a role in incubating and developing this global digital ecosystem through innovative partnerships across stakeholders.
