# R & D for a New Foundation Technology for offshore Wind Farms at Great Deep (CEO)

[![[attachments/KV.resources/unknown_filename.1.jpeg]]](http://93.189.88.106/sites/default/files/images_proyecto/aerogeneradores03.jpg)

Area: 

[R & D](http://www.kvconsultores.es/en/r-d)

Date: 

2011

Location: 

Madrid

## Descripción:

The overall project objective is to develop a new foundation technology for offshore wind turbines that will make possible the technological increase required for installation of these structures in deep sea (about 30 to 50 meters). The design consists of a reinforced concrete box executed in caissons. Boxes are built on the coast and then it is transported floating to its final location, after that is anchored and filled with sand and then put over it the wind turbine tower. This new technology also seeks benefits in areas such as environment, transportation and operation.

The consortium is composed of two entities: SATO and KV Consultores in collaboration with the Institute IH Cantabria, formed by the Cantabria Government and the University of Cantabria.

Co-financing body: CDTI
