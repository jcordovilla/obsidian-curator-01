# PEDALES
## Pro Co RAT2 Distortion Pedal - 100 Pavos

![[attachments/PEDALES.resources/unknown_filename.jpeg]]Here is something more suitable for people who are after modern sounds. The original Pro Co “The RAT” was modeled in the mid-1970s, by engineers Scott Burnham and Steve Kiraly who decided to build a superior product of the widely popular Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face.

Since then the RAT found it’s way to a handful of professional musicians such as Dave Grohl, Graham Coxon, Andy Summers, Jerry Cantrell and others. The pedal is based upon same scheme as the Boss DS-1 distortion pedal, although there are major differences between the circuits, which account for the huge difference in the sound between the two pedals. Some also compare it to the Big Muff, but say that the Muff offers more of a fuzz sound, and Pro Co gives you that raw distortion. The RAT2 is perfect for playing heavy and dirty power chords, and in contrast to some other pedals mentioned, this one proves to be great as a stand alone distortion.  Playing with the knobs you can dial in many different tones, ranging from  fuzz-like distortion, warm blues, treble-high metal tones and many others. As far as the built quality goes, it is as good as it gets, and RAT2 will probably end up lasting you decades.

If you are into grunge, punk or even some metal, this pedal is essential. It can do nearly everything you’d expect from a distortion pedal, and if you still find yourself confused with what model out of all these you should buy for yourself, we would differently recommend getting the RAT2.

## Electro Harmonix Big Muff Pi - 80 Pavos

![[attachments/PEDALES.resources/unknown_filename.1.jpeg]]Big Muff Pi is widely recognized as one of the most iconic effect pedals, and you can hear it in David Gilmour’s solos and Jack White’s dirty riffs – among others.

The pedals itself is pretty robust, and features really simple and lowly design. You get to play around with three knobs, responsible for volume, tone and sustain. With knobs set up in right position, you can achieve that warm fuzzy sounds from Hendrix, or if you wish, something on the other side of the spectrum like Smashing Pumpkins or even AC/DC. Although the pedal lacks in versatility when compared to some other pedals, the sound quality that it offers really makes it worthwhile. Some players argue that this is really not a pedal to be used by itself, but paired with more “adaptable” pedals.

This guitar pedal one is really something special, and the people who decide to buy it, usually end up falling in love with the sound. If you’re into White Stripes, Hendrix and especially David Gilmour (who uses this effect as his main) the Big Muff is a must-have. With the Big Muff Pi you get that basic fuzzy sound, but delivered in a best possible quality.
