# US Governors Add Support for Extension of Wind Tax Incentives

A group representing US governors has called on Congress to approve a medium-term extension of federal tax credits for renewable energy and to include investment in the first 3GW of offshore wind installations.

The production tax credit (PTC) is available for utility-scale wind farms placed in service this year, and for other renewable energy projects that come online prior to 1 January 2014. A 30% investment tax credit (ITC) for geothermal expires at the end of next year, and for small wind and solar facilities on 31 December 2016.

Congress in 2009 passed a similar ITC for offshore wind projects applicable if construction began by 31 December this year. Developers have been unable to use it due to a lengthy and uncertain permitting process that the [Interior Department](http://www.doi.gov/) has sought to streamline and clarify.

The governors appeared to be throwing their support behind Senate Bill 1397, the Incentivizing Offshore Wind Act, co-sponsored by Senators Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat, and Olympia Snowe, a Maine Republican. Once declared eligible for the ITC, the bill allows developers five years to bring a project into commercial operation. The tax break is limited to an initial 3GW of installations.

“Predictable tax policies provide a foundation for renewable energy development can play an important role in our nation’s economic recovery. Therefore, we are encouraging an extension of both the PTC and ITC for at least 4 years,” Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, chair of the Natural Resources Committee of the [National Governors Association](http://www.nga.org/) , wrote leaders of the US House of Representatives and Senate.

The letter, also signed by South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard, the committee vice chair, and written on behalf of the chief executives of all 50 states, says that tax credits for renewable energy development create jobs and can help promote environmentally responsible, efficient and secure affordable energy.

Malloy is a Democrat and Daugaard is a Republican. By party, the group includes 29 Republicans and 20 Democrats, plus one independent governor. It also has five governors of US commonwealths and territories.

The letter again highlights the sharp differences within the Republican Party over to what extent the federal government should back renewables and wind energy specifically. Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential candidate in November, has shown little enthusiasm for continuing federal support. Many Congressional Republicans also want funding cutbacks and generally do not see offshore wind as a funding priority.

By contrast, most Republican governors embrace renewable energy, and support federal and state policies that advance the wind industry.
