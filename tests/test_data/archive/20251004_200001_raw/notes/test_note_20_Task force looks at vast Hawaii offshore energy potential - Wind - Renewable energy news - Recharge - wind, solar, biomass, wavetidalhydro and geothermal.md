# Task Force Looks at Vast Hawaii offshore Energy Potential

A federal-state offshore renewable energy task force held its first meeting in Hawaii, which may have more wind energy resource within 50 miles of its coasts than any US state other than Alaska.

The task force is patterned after others formed with 10 East Coast states and Oregon that allow the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and other federal agencies to coordinate and consult with officials and stakeholders in states on potential renewable energy development on the outer continental shelf (OCS).

[BOEM](http://www.boem.gov/), part of the [US Interior Departmen](http://www.doi.gov/)t, oversees that effort on submerged lands under federal control more than 3 miles (4.8km) from shore, except for wave energy development that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administers.

Wind is potentially the largest energy resource in Hawaii but space is limited for development on the more populous islands. Water depths and viewshed considerations limit nearshore wind energy development opportunities, prompting some experts to view Hawaii as better suited for floating wind turbine applications.

Hawaii depends on fuel oil to generate 90% of its electricity. The state has an ambitious renewable portfolio standard requiring that 40% of power sold by electric utilities come from renewable sources by 2030.

“Hawaii is home to a wide range of natural energy resources and is fast becoming a major test bed for innovative alternative and renewable energy projects,” says [Governor Neil Abercrombie](http://www.hawaii.gov/) .

These include the 400MW inter-island development plan known as Big Wind that includes a subsea transmission line to bring electricity generated by wind on the islands of Lanai and Molokai to the most populous island of Oahu.
