# New Regulations concerning Power Purchase in Indonesia

**Introduction**

On 28 June 2016, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) issued Regulation No. 19 of 2016 concerning the power purchase from Solar Photovoltaic Plants by PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (Regulation 19), which revokes the former MEMR Regulation No. 17 of 2013 (Regulation 17). Similar with Regulation 17, the new Regulation 19 obliges the Indonesian monopolist energy distributor PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) to purchase electricity generated from a solar photovoltaic power plant owned by a business entity which has been declared as solar photovoltaic power plant developer (Developer) by MEMR with a price as determined by Regulation 19.

At the first stage Regulation 19 offers quota capacity in the amount of 250 MWp spreading from Java Island to Papua.  The quota capacity is the maximum amount of energy capacity that can be offered to a potential solar plant developer by PLN in one offering period. The purchase price of electricity also varies from one area to another. The lowest price is for electricity generated from solar photovoltaic located in Java Island, i.e. 14.5 USD Cent/kwh and the highest price is electricity generated from solar photovoltaic in Papua Island, i.e. 25 USD Cent/kwh.

**New requirements for Developer candidates**

Under Regulation 17, in order to be determined as a Developer, a business entity had to participate in an auction process.  This requirement is not valid anymore.  Under Regulation 19, MEMR will determine the Developer on a first-come-first-serve basis.  Set below is the current procedure to be determined as a Developer by MEMR:

1. Register as a Developer candidate through an online system to be launched by MEMR;

* MEMR will verify documentation submitted by the candidate;
* MEMR will announce and inform the candidate who is eligible to apply quota capacity;
* Candidate submits application to have quota capacity to MEMR;
* MEMR will verify documentation of quota capacity submitted by candidate;
* MEMR will declare the candidate a Developer of specific quota capacity.

 

To be registered as a Developer candidate, a foreign investor needs to establish a foreign investment limited liability company under Indonesian law (PMA Company). The establishment of the PMA Company is subject to certain investment regulations and restrictions, among others, Presidential Regulation No. 44 of 2016 (Negative List). Pursuant to the Negative List,  maximum foreign ownership in a PMA Company which operates on a small scale (1 – 10 MW) is 49% and large scale (capacity >10MW) is 95%. This local partner requirement should be considered by foreign investors when planning their project.

The amount of quota capacity that could be applied by the Developer candidate is as follows:

Furthermore, Regulation 19 stipulates that, in order to construct the Solar Photovoltaic Plants (SPP), the Developer should give priority to local products observing the minimum Local Components Level in accordance with Ministry of Industrial Regulation No. 54/M-IND/PER/2/2012 concerning the guideline to use local products to construct electricity infrastructure. Regulation 19 provides that the components used in the SPP shall comply with international and Indonesian national standards. This also applies to the construction of the SPP for which further PLN standards need to be taken into account.

Moreover, Regulation 19 reaffirms that the validity of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between the SPP developer and PLN is 20 years from the Commercial Operation Date and could be extended. However, Regulation 19 does not stipulate further details regarding the extension of the PPA.

In addition, as included in the transitional provisions of Regulation 19, a company which currently conducts the power sale and purchase based on a business to business arrangement with PLN and has not executed the PPA may continue the procurement process and sign the PPA with PLN.
