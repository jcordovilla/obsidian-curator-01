## Curator Summary

I'm unable to extract readable text from the provided image via OCR. The image itself appears to be a photo of a panel recommendation with some annotations, but no clear text is visible.

Here are the requested details:

1) DESCRIPTION: 
The image shows a photo of a panel recommendation with changes to EPA water affordability guidelines. No EXIF metadata is available for analysis.

2) KEY OBSERVATIONS:
* The image appears to be a formal document or report with some annotations.
* A title "Panel Recommends Changes to Two-Decade-Old EPA Water Affordability Guidelines" is visible, but no text beyond this is readable.
* Some numbers and dates are present in the annotations, but they cannot be extracted due to poor OCR quality.

3) USE-IN-WRITING:
* This image could support an argument related to changes in water affordability guidelines.
* It could also illustrate the importance of updating outdated regulations.

4) CONFIDENCE & ACTION: 
The reliability of this image as evidence is limited due to poor OCR quality, and further verification of the text extraction is necessary.
