DURING the first world war Heinrich Barkhausen, a German physicist, carried into the trenches an antenna, a crude electronic amplifier and a pair of headphones. His mission: to intercept Allied field-telephone communications. The strange noises he heard among the transmissions were not, as he thought, a problem with his equipment; later it was discovered that these “whistlers” were radiofrequency bursts from extremely distant lightning. Barkhausen was among the first scientists to learn something new about the world from sound alone.

By the 1960s, seismologists were using instruments that recorded local tremblings as frequency modulations on magnetic tape. Days and weeks of data lay on these tapes, and the only way to sift through them for interesting events was to play them back at high speed, listening for any anomalies. The field of sonification—turning data into sound—had been born. When the _Voyager 2_ space probe passed Saturn in 1981 and sent back a stream of data that its keepers could not decipher, they sonified it. The hailstorm-like sound, they determined, came from debris in Saturn’s rings striking the craft.

Sonifications make for attention-grabbing sounds on the news, so these days many scientific findings are sonified. Overwhelmingly, though, these are an afterthought; scientists still rely on their eyes and algorithms to spot interesting phenomena. That looks set to change as more scientists, engineers and even designers and artists look to exploit better what the seismologists and _Voyager_ scientists knew decades ago: sound can be the key to scientific discovery.

Bring the noise

One person currently championing sonification is Robert Alexander, a design scientist from the University of Michigan who spent time as a fellow at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre. His work with data from satellites measuring the stream of particles from the sun has yielded a number of discoveries (and also a number of musical compositions).

That is because hearing presents a different set of strengths from that of vision. Humans can hear frequencies across three orders of magnitude, from about 20 to 20,000 hertz, and can discern tiny differences in those frequencies. They can deal with volumes from that of a pin dropping to a rock concert. Perhaps hearing’s greatest strength is its temporal resolution, 100 times finer than that of vision: you will know if your favourite band’s drummer is as little as a few thousandths of a second late on the beat.

Dr Alexander found, through listening alone, that ions of carbon are better at indicating the regions from which the solar wind originates than the oxygen that was previously employed, and determined the cause of a long-lived storm of swirling particles within the wind. He even spotted an undocumented source of noise in the instruments aboard the _Ulysses_ spacecraft.

A greater influence than these discrete discoveries, though, is the enthusiasm for sonification they have created among his colleagues. Lan Jian, a solar scientist at Goddard, has learned that sonification is a great way to search for unusual events within data from _WIND_, another spacecraft sent to observe the sun. It speeds things up by a factor of ten or more, she says. Dr Alexander has gone on to publish a kind of best-practice sonification guide for researchers swimming in the copious data from sun-studying satellites.

Such success stories remain rare, as visual analysis of data still dominates the sciences. Yet vision has its limits. Many experiments measure a slew of variables at once, and the trick is to discover which of these are connected and how. As visual display technology has improved greatly it has been possible to display data in enhanced ways, but it is becoming a struggle. “Now we’re seeing people looking at very complicated graphs; they’re overloaded by data, and the visual system can’t handle it all,” says Matthew Schneps of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics.

Dr Alexander’s work—and indeed much of the work in science so far—falls under a category of sonification called audification. When a single measure is taken at regular intervals, the result is a simple stream of regularly spaced points. Audification is simply the shifting of such “time-series data” to a frequency within the audible range—exactly what the seismologists, _Voyager 2_ scientists and lots of early radio astronomers did. As a reflection of change in just one variable in time, audification results in simple tones and rhythms.

But hearing can discern much more than just pitch and pace: it can pick up multiple instruments with differing timbres, keeping track of each note’s pitch, and even its attack and decay—how fast it rises and falls in volume. That is where another kind of sonification called parameter mapping comes in. This can turn scads of data sources into one stream of sound. The rise and fall of one variable is mapped to, say, the volume of a synthesised violin, while the shift of another is mapped to its pitch. Many different timbres of sound can be added, resulting in a data-rich soundscape.

Human hearing is extremely good at dealing with such noisy input. Making out what your interlocutor is saying at a crowded cocktail party, or noticing the approach of a predator among the cacophony of birds and bugs in a rainforest, can be done. “Where there are subtle changes of noise, or patterns in the change, that’s where the ear really takes over,” says Andy Hunt, of the University of York, in Britain.

Intelligent design

Dr Hunt has parameter-mapped data ranging from images of cervical cells being screened for cancer to electrical signals from the muscles of recovering stroke patients. He has also worked with data from several hundred sensors fitted to helicopters during test flights. These data used to be printed out and laid on the hangar floor; engineers walked along them for hours, looking for anything untoward. Dr Hunt parameter-mapped the same data and turned them into a sound file, just seconds long, in which problems could be spotted.

David Worrall of the Australian National University believes parameter-mapping sonifications are particularly suited to monitoring of complex systems. When he began to work with the Fraunhofer Institute, in Germany, on a project to analyse network activity as a proxy for how much different departments were co-operating, those in the institute’s IT department were sceptical. But through regular listening to his sonification, he says “they started to notice patterns in the flow of the network—this would happen, then that, and then suddenly the printer drivers would go down.” What began as a managerial query has become a network-monitoring tool. Dr Worrall has also developed a sonification of the stockmarket for an Australian government research group, in order to spot insider trading.

How precisely to carry out such parameter mapping is a subject of ongoing study; experiments have shown that volunteers tasked with plucking out sounds of interest find it easier when listening to some mappings than to others. That can depend in part on how easy the resulting sonifications are on the ear, especially if they are being monitored all day.

“If you want anyone to use your sonification, it shouldn’t sound too disturbing or give you a headache,” says Alexandra Supper, a sociologist at the University of Maastricht, in the Netherlands, “but at the same time there can also be a danger of making it sound too pleasing, such that it becomes background music.”

For sonification to become more widespread, researchers must bridge this divide. For Dr Worrall—a composer by training—the answer is in design, which he says “is an uncomfortable bedfellow” for both scientists and artists. But Paul Vickers of the University of Northumbria, in Britain, says progress is being made in breaking down scientists’ conservative nature and bringing in aesthetic elements in a serious and rigorous way. “We’re seeing people working in the scientific domains engaging with philosophers of music and psychologists, and thinking about how we listen in the real world to inform how we design sonifications.” Sounds promising.
