# PANOS PANAY - CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION

Sobre la expresión: no limitarse al disco. No seguir el canon. Entregar por volúmenes. Vol 1. Vol 2. Etc…

Music as a framework for innovation and problem solving.![[attachments/PANOS_PANAY_-_CREATIVITY_AND_INNOVATION.resources/Evernote 20180711 10-20-17.wav]]

Most of the institutions around are frameworks for interpreting how things work. Economics is a framework.

Design Thinking is a framework for problem solving.

Biobeats: app that recommends music based on your biological parameters.

IBM Watson song made it to #3 in the billboard.

Artform platform. Music as a platform for people to collaborate.

==PRACTICE THE ART OF WHY NOT??==

EXPERIMENTATION

It takes a lot of discipline. 

Experimentation without discipline is a mess.

Leonardo’s biography.

Emotion affects motion.

Music creates a distortion of reality.

Business can do that, too.

Nobody cares about what you are doing unless you tell them.

If you don’t tell people about what you are doing, you will never succeed. The ability to go out and sell your ideas and convince people is just as important.

Failing is just a step in learning. But just saying that is not enough.

Entrepreneurship is not about taking risks, it is about mitigating risks. It is about experimenting while protecting your self from the possibility of failure.

Reinvention is tough. The best artists are masters of reinvention.

[[Temporal resolution of hearing is 100 times greater than that of vision]] Visual analysis still dominates, but sound analysis (sonification = turning data into sound) would be more effective for certain things. Non-linear interaction. Complex systems. Transient phenomena. ==The qlik of sound==.

Questions for reflection:

* When was the last time you collaborated with someone completely outside your field?
* How tolerant are you of experimentation and failure?
* Would you ever hire someone based only on their creativity?
* Are you busy managing or busy reinventing?

==Athletes are obsessed with control, winning always in the same conditions. Musicians collaborate to raise emotions in constantly changing environments. More adaptive.==

==Helping turn institutions into organisms. Bringing creativity, collaboration and flexibility to institutions.==

conventional institutions don’t have rhythm, no harmonics.

Creative people are, by nature, anti-institutional.

Clayton Christensen: companies fail precisely because they are well managed.

Creating something new runs counter all the processes of good management.
