## Curator Summary

**DESCRIPTION**

The image shows a technical diagram of the Cranfield nano membrane toilet, created in 2018. The diagram includes various components such as holding tanks, Archimedes screws, gasifiers, heat exchangers, and membranes. The image is a scan or photograph of a document excerpt.

**KEY OBSERVATIONS**

* A rotating flush blocks odour and transfers waste into the holding tank for separate processing.
* Solid waste sinks to the bottom of the holding tank for a settling period.
* An Archimedes screw carries sludge upwards, converting it into small pellets.
* The pellets are dried and burned in a gasifier to produce energy.
* Liquid waste is warmed as it passes around the exhaust of the gasifier, converted into pure, pathogen-free water.
* The water then condenses on the heat exchanger and is stored in a reservoir.

**USE-IN-WRITING**

1. This image could support an argument about the feasibility of sustainable waste management technologies in infrastructure investment by illustrating the processing steps involved in the Cranfield nano membrane toilet.
2. It could also be used to highlight the importance of energy production from waste in reducing environmental impact, citing the diagram and its source (Cranfield University).
3. The image might support a discussion on the potential for water purification technologies in infrastructure development, emphasizing the effectiveness of the heat exchanger and reservoir system.

**CONFIDENCE & ACTION**

The reliability of this image as evidence is moderate due to the lack of metadata or OCR text beyond the provided excerpt. Further verification of the extracted information through additional sources (e.g., Cranfield University publications) is recommended.
