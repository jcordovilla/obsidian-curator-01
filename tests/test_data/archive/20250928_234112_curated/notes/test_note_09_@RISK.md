## Curator Summary

**DESCRIPTION**

The image shows a screenshot of Microsoft Excel with various financial data and calculations displayed in cells. The metadata indicates it was taken on October 3, 2016.

**KEY OBSERVATIONS**

*   **Financial Model:** The image appears to be a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis.
*   **Uncertain Inputs:** The model uses several uncertain inputs represented by probability distributions, including:
    *   Initial Investment Cost ($100,000)
    *   Annual Income ($96,667, $101,500, $106,575, etc.)
    *   Annual Fixed Cost ($35,000)
    *   Variable Cost (linked to income, percentages 50% and 2%)
    *   Annual Income Growth (with Normal and Lognormal distributions)
*   **Outputs:** The model calculates and displays outputs, including the Net Present Value (VAN).
*   **Distribution Types:** The model utilizes Normal and Lognormal distributions for input variables.

**USE-IN-WRITING**

1.  This image could support an argument in a technical brief or report by illustrating the use of probability distributions in financial modeling.
2.  It demonstrates the application of DCF analysis in evaluating investment projects.
3.  The image can be used to explain the concept of uncertain inputs and their representation using probability distributions.

**CONFIDENCE & ACTION**

The reliability of this image as evidence is moderate due to the presence of OCR text, which may contain errors or inaccuracies. Verification of the text extraction process is recommended to ensure accuracy.
