**ICEBREAKER ONE**

User’s n ame, role and organisation: José is Managing Partner at Solvere Infraestructuras in Madrid

Describe the problems this user faces: Lack of curated, reliable and up-to-date data on infrastructure and the environment

What are their data needs? Curated, reliable and up-to-date data on infrastructure assets (roads, railways, water plants, power lines, telecom, etc.) and the environment

What are their blockers to finding data? Most of the data are not available on government’s websites, nor on private companies who own or operate them. When available, the data repositories are cumbersome and the search engines unfriendly.

What are their blockers to accessing data? Messy repositories, disaggregation, heterogeneity, unavailability, slow servers

What are their blockers to using data? Not up-to-date. Lack of relevance. Incomplete records. Doubts about reliability.

What are the data gaps? Spatial data on infrastructure. Data about asset characteristics, condition and service performance. Data about environmental impact and management. Data about infrastructure users. Data about regulations and contracts pertinent to the assets. Data about risk exposure and management.

What if ... ?  If only we had up-to-date, rich spatial information about infrastructure assets and their use, we could improve how infrastructure is planned, financed, developed, operated and maintained, reducing risk and increasing public value considerably.
