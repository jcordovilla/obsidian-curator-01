Mark Hellowell, a PFI expert at the University of Edinburgh, warned that the contracts “had been designed to discourage termination. They would never have been agreed if the state could just move in and end the deal at no charge”.

He said the government would have to pay the outstanding balance on the debt, the market value of the shares if they had been sold in the secondary market as well as the cost of breaking hedging contracts, which nearly all of them have.

It is one of Britain’s most successful financial exports — used to build bridges, toll roads, schools and hospitals in cities from Manchester to Mumbai.

But even as the popularity of [private finance initiative schemes](https://www.ft.com/content/0161cc52-a1e9-11e7-9e4f-7f5e6a7c98a2) increases abroad, it has fallen so far from favour in its home country that on Monday, the opposition Labour party said that if it won power, it would not only stop using PFI altogether but would look at bringing some projects back in-house.

With 716 projects and a capital value of £60bn, according to the Treasury, that is no mean feat. But the shares in many of the largest PFI contractors and infrastructure funds barely moved on the announcement.

Iain Scouller of Steifel Investment Fund Research said the announcement in a speech by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was seen as a “bit of rhetoric rather than concrete proposals”. But he added that if it went ahead it would cost “tens of billions” to compensate investors.

Although some are still in the original contractors’ hands, most existing PFI schemes have been sold on to investors, which include seven listed UK infrastructure funds including John Laing Infrastructure Fund and HICL Infrastructure. Typically, shares in the listed funds are held by pension funds, private individuals and other investors who would cost “tens of billions” to compensate, Mr Scouller said.

“If you’re going to lose a 30-year dividend stream we’re talking about billions of pounds of future income they are going to lose out on,” he said.

He added that nationalisation would make it difficult for future governments to raise private sector investment in infrastructure. “If the government wants pensions funds to get involved in projects — whether it’s housing or transport — it will make it very difficult to get future funding if they haven’t been fully compensated,” he said.

Top five companies by value of all their PFI projects

| Company name | Sum of capital value (£m) |
| --- | --- |
| AirTanker | 2,687.63 |
| Aspire Defence | 1,583.30 |
| Airbus Defence and Space | 1,360.93 |
| Capital Hospitals | 1,149 |
| Trillium (Prime) | 990 |

Infrastructure funds, which receive a steady stream of revenue in return for maintaining completed public assets such as schools, hospitals and roads, had already been increasing the proportion of their assets invested in foreign portfolios. Although they tend to invest in projects only after the lengthy construction process is complete, there are already fewer projects in the pipeline.

The schemes have been heavily criticised in Britain for years. George Osborne, the former chancellor, described them as “totally discredited” in 2010.

A revamped system — dubbed PF2 — which gave the public sector a larger role, in effect as a minority shareholder, has failed to deliver as many projects, though the government has recently reaffirmed its commitment to using it for projects including the Lower Thames Crossing and a number of schools.

Jonathan Hart, infrastructure expert and partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, said that given the “continued absence” of PF2s, some may struggle to see any difference from a blanket ban on future PFIs.

The biggest users of PFI and PF2

| Government department | Capital value (£m) |
| --- | --- |
| Department of Health | 12,953.2 |
| Ministry of Defence | 9,519.71 |
| Department for Education | 8,585.35 |
| Department for Transport | 7,840.65 |

Only one health trust so far has managed to exit its PFI contract. In 2014, the [Northumbria Healthcare Foundation Trust](https://www.ft.com/content/cc4f10b2-4951-11e4-8d68-00144feab7de) became the first to buy out its contract, borrowing £114m from the local council to pay off private contractors who built and ran Hexham General Hospital.

Phil Lobb, head of health at Deloitte who has advised on PFI contracts, said the Hexham deal “proved that these transactions could be done in the right circumstances”. “It’s hard to have a blanket policy though as each PFI scheme is so different,” he added.
