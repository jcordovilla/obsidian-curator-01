A flurry of dealmaking has begun among firms that provide companies with environmental, social and governance ratings, fed by increasing demand for the data among investors and regulators.

The sector has traditionally been dominated by index providers such as MSCI and a handful of specialist firms, such as Sustainalytics. Now Moody’s and S&P Global, two of the big three credit rating agencies, are elbowing their way in, offering separate ESG scores on companies in addition to their traditional assessments of creditworthiness.

Moody’s made a splash earlier this year when it bought a majority stake in [Vigeo Eiris](https://www.ft.com/content/2cd37df8-a973-3f94-b498-09ee1a6ba53b), one of the most prominent European ESG research outfits, which traces its roots back to the beginning of the socially responsible investing movement in the early 1980s. Moody’s also later bought [Four Twenty Seven](http://427mt.com/2019/07/24/four-twenty-seven-receives-majority-investment-from-moodys-corporation/), a climate research specialist named after one of California’s emissions targets — 427m tonnes of carbon.

S&P has a long history of partnering with RobecoSAM, an asset manager that specialises in sustainability research, to create the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, but it is now staking out its own ESG ratings business. The New York-based company published its [first](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sp-global-ratings-publishes-its-first-esg-evaluation-300869435.html) ESG evaluation in June.

Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners, an equity analyst who covers MSCI, estimates that the global market for ESG ratings is currently worth about $200m and says that could grow to $500m within five years.

Last year, MSCI’s ESG research division saw a 30 per cent rise in turnover, to $71m, and has kept up a similar rate of expansion this year.

Moody’s and S&P “know this will be a big market in the future and it will only grow,” said Florian Berg, postdoctoral research associate at MIT Sloan School of Management.

ESG ratings have risen in popularity among investors who have started focusing more heavily on matters of sustainability. The European Parliament and EU member states [agreed](https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-1571_en.htm) to new sustainability disclosure rules in March. The regulation is likely to force the hands of investors that, to date, have shied away from ESG disclosures, said Remy Briand, head of ESG at MSCI.

“In some shape or form, essentially, we think investors will have to report on climate risk,” he said. The company [bought](https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-201909090300BIZWIRE_USPRX____BW5263-1) a climate research company called Carbon Delta last week to broaden its ratings business, Mr Briand added.

The third of the big three credit rating agencies, Fitch, has so far stayed out of the ESG ratings market, but is also making a push to highlight how it uses ESG to determine companies’ creditworthiness. Incidents such as the bankruptcy of California utility Pacific Gas & Electric, which was held liable for billions of dollars in [damages from wildfires](https://www.ft.com/content/1a407ece-239f-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632), show how ESG factors such as climate change can create material financial risks.

“PG&E made everyone wake up and say this is for real and this isn’t going away,” said Christina Wong, director at Sustainability, a research consultancy.

==In regular credit ratings, companies are graded only on ESG risks that have a direct impact on their ability to pay their debts. “ESG factors may or may not be material. If they are, we will write about them. If not, we’re not going to talk about it,” said Susan Gray, the global head of corporate ratings at S&P.==

==For separate ESG ratings, the analysis goes deeper. “The goal on ESG ratings is to look at the sustainability of the business model of the issuer,” said Myriam Durand, global head of assessments at Moody’s. However, what that means varies from agency to agency.==

==This lack of standardisation can be confusing for companies, whose ESG scores often do not match up across agencies. Research conducted by Mr Berg shows ESG ratings from different sources are aligned in about 6 out of 10 cases, whereas regular ratings for creditworthiness match 99 per cent of the time.==

==Industry bodies such as the San Francisco-based Sustainable Accounting Standards Board are trying to fix this problem, but industry experts think a single rating spectrum is a long way off yet.==

“I don’t think there will ever be just one rating,” said Ms Wong. “I think of it like sellside research . . . You’re never going to have one analyst who knows every market and every company.”
