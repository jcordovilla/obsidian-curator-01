# Nordex Q1 Orders up 84%

John McKenna, Windpower Monthly, 02 April 2012, 10:27am

GERMANY: Nordex’s orders for the first quarter of 2012 were up 84% on order levels for the first three months of 2011, the turbine manufacturer revealed today.

The firm announced that orders for January to March 2012 totalled €284 million, compared to just €154 million for the same period last year.

 

Nordex said the dramatic turnaround marked the start of anticipated strong sales growth during 2012, fuelled by its strong order backlog, which stood at around €700 million at the end of 2011.

As well as revealing Q1 order levels, Nordex also today confirmed its [preliminary annual results for 2011](http://www.windpowermonthly.com/news/1119537/Nordex-suffers-80-drop-sales-China/), announced in February  .

 

Today marked the first day in his role for Nordex’s new chief executive Jürgen Zeschky, following [his appointment](http://www.windpowermonthly.com/news/1102898/Nordex-announces-CEO-replacement-Richterich/) in November last year.

 

Zeschky said the firm would continue on its path of "strategic reorientation" to move away from offshore turbine development and focus on "its profitable core business in turbines for onshore wind farms".
