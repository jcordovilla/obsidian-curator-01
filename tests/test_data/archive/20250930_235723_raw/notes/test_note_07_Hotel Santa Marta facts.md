# Hotel Santa Marta Facts

Hi Mason.

Here is a summary of the history of Hotel Santa Marta.

\- Before 2008, there was a bungalow-style low-densit hotel, very nicely integrated in the neighborhood and the environment. The total built-up area was around 3,000 m2. I have attached a set of pictures for visual reference as appendix A. They have been downloaded from Panoramio and Google maps, so they will probably have copyrights.

\- The plot is classified as H-1 (existing hotels) in the urban planning regulations. This zoning allows for a maximum 55% of plot occupation and basement+3 storeys + attic. In 2004 the promoter took the first step to build a new, larger hotel, by submitting what is called "propuesta de ordenación de volúmenes", which suggested that, since the existing hotel would be demolished, it could changed to a different zoning type called H-3. In Spain it is not allowed to change the zoning of a plot in Plan General unless Plan General itself is changed, something that requires going through the regional government. Interestingly enough, this new zoning H-3 was introduced in the urban regulations some time before, creating an ambiguous zoning that could apply to both new and existing hotels and of course allowing for greater building densities and heights (basement+4 storeys+attic). I attach an excerpt from the existing Urban Plan (PGOU) where all three hotel type zonings are defined, as appendix B.

\- The Mayor Antonio Barrientos, as you now the main suspect in Caso Astapa, approved the proposal for a new, radically bigger hotel over 21,000m2 built, in 2005. The approval was by 'Decreto de Alcaldia', which means that it was the Mayor himself and alone who signed it, instead of the habitual approval by the council. The approval was 'backed' by 'informes' from both the municipal architect and lawyer saying that the change in zoning could be justified because of the general interest that the new hotel represented for the citizens of Estepona. I attach the 2007 approval as Appendix C, and the reports by the architect and lawyer as D and E, respectively. The license included a 600,000 Euro bond to ensure compliance with the license specifications.

\- The license specified that 137 of the existing trees should be untouched and preserved, and another 135 could be transplanted and preserved, in accordance with the specifications by the municipal Ingeniero Agronomo (appendix F). Most of these trees disappeared shortly after construction started. Denuncias were made about this at the town hall but nothing ever happened. We suspect that the Town Hall never kept the bond 'in exchange' so they could pay municipal wages in 2010 and 2011 but we have no evidence to prove it. I attach photos of the cutting of the trees as appendix G.

\- On October 13th, 2010, the community filed a complaint at Fiscalia de Marbella to denounce the wrongdoings. I attach evidence as appendix H. In the subsequent months we were repeatedly told that the file was moving very slowly because the institution was saturated with other cases. In 2012 we insisted again, we were told that they had forwarded the complaint to Fiscalia Provincial de Malaga, but after checking with the latter, we found that this forwarding never happened. This is, the file was lost. Malaga suggested us to file a new complaint directly at their premises to avoid further trouble. In October 2012 I filed a new complaint, this time as an individual.

\- A complaint was also filed at Junta de Andalucia by the community in 2008. The result was: Junta wrote to the Town Hall to request an explanation, the Town Hall said there was no problem and Junta accepted the explanation.

\- Not only the developer got a license he should have never received, but now they are not even complying with this license. The cut down the trees and are building higher and closer to the neighbours than they should. I attach pictures where you can see they are building 7 storeys, one more than they are allowed, as appendix I. Several neighbours filed complaints at the town hall about the building setback issue in March. In April the municipal architect made a site visit and decided to write an order to stop the works on the west side, next to our properties, but as of today the order has not been signed by the Mayor. Interestingly enough, we called Fiscalia and found that the Fiscal had sent a requirement for information about our denuncia in early April, which explains the speed at which the town hall reacted to the complaints by the neighbours this time.

The stop order would -according to words by the municipal architect- force the developer to submit a new design and application for license modification within 2 months, as well as pay a fine for breaching the existing license.

During all this time the community has also engaged architects and lawyers to study the case and issue expert witness reports to back our complaints at fiscalia and town hall. I attach the two expert reports we received as appendices J and K.

Mr Finn Jensen also filed a complaint at the EU Commission but he will be able to give you details about this.

At the moment we are waiting for something to happen with the heights and distances as well as fiscalia.

Once again, please do not mention any personal names if you use this information.
