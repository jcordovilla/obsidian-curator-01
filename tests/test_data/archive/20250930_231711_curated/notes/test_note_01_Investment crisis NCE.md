world invests “50% less
than it should” in infrastructure
which is now in crisis, said infra-
structure analyst and project

consultant CG/LA Infrastruc-
ture president and chief executive
Norman Anderson.

He was speaking during a
private meeting at the Global
Infrastructure Leadership Forum
in London last week.

After the event, he told NCEI
that the problems were common
across the world and stemmed
from banking crises.

“The loss of private banks,
means there’s no capital and no
expertise,” said Anderson.

Infrastructure UK (IUK) chief
executive Geoffrey Spence agreed
there was a problem. He told the

Forum’s keynote event that there
had been a backlash against the
private finance initiative (PFI)
and public private partnerships
(PPPs).

“There’s been a breakdown in

“I’m a bit embarrassed to talk
about PFI with our friends over-
seas at the moment and we've had
to reduce our engagement with
the overseas finance ministries.”

He added that the Treasury's

PFI consultation exercise had just
ended and received 150 responses.

Despite problems with this
vehicle, Spence said that the UK
— helped by its plans to open
up infrastructure investment to
pensions — was open for business

need money- Pension funds, sover.
eign funds, family offices — they all
have money [to invest], he said,

“But essentially pension funds

are the most risk averse group of
them all.”

‘At the closed event, the speakers
also expressed concern that too
much attention was focused on
how to pay for infrastructure and
not enough on strategically prior-
itising projects. Some have argued
that this has resulted in too much

attention being focused on major

commitment to pension fund
involvement in infrastruc-
ture investment pointing to
the organisation’s decision to
help set up the Pension Infra-
structure Platform. This aims
to tap into the $1.2bn that UK
pension funds could invest in
infrastructure. He refused to
say when it would be set up,
however.

Anderson said that it was
unlikely that pension fund invest-
ment would solve all of the prob-

projects.

“The basic problem is that we
see infrastructure through the
paradigm of major projects,”
said contractor Geoffrey Osborne
chairman Simon Murray.

“(In developing countries]
usually the appropriate solu-
tion is to build new infrastruc-
ture,” he said. “However, if you
look at the UK economy [and that
of places like the United States]
we have broadly satisfied the

requirements for infrastructure

— instead it’s about the quality of

service and price.

“T don’t think building large
new infrastructure projects is
usually the solution. We should
be 100 tae at innovative ways of
maintaining our assets, but we're
way behind the pace.”
Anderson countered that
