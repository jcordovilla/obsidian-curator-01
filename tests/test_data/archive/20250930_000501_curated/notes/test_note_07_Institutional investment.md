Institutional Investment

From Bloomberg new energy finance march 2012:

“They want investment–grade....they want liquidity, and scale helps with liquidity....but they want standardisation as well." He added: "There is no other way to go forward, other than tapping these markets. It is time for capital markets to play.”

However there are signs of increased interest from traditional institutional investors. PensionDanmark, one of the largest pension funds in Denmark, has moved ahead of its peer group by making substantial, direct investments in renewable power projects.

Torben Moger Pedersen, its managing director, recounted how his organisation had gone into a partnership with Dong Energy to take equity stakes in two large offshore wind parks. “We have accessed large infrastructure assets with a very attractive rate of return of between 6.5% and 9%, with a risk much lower than investments in the listed equity markets,” he said.

Asked what proportion of PensionDanmark’s $23bn of assets were in renewable energy, he replied: “We have invested or committed $1.5bn to solar and offshore wind projects. We aim to allocate around 10% to this kind of project in the coming years.” Pedersen added that he expected to see “a number of European, Canadian and Australian pension funds doing the same that we have”
