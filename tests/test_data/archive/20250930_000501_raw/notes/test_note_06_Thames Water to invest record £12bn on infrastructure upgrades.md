# Thames Water to Invest Record £12bn on Infrastructure Upgrades

Utilities group vows to keep average bills flat, but rivals signal cuts

Britain’s biggest water company plans to invest a record amount on improving infrastructure and will cap payouts to investors in a bid to help repair its reputation after a barrage of criticism over its performance.

Thames Water, which supplies more than 15m people, said it would invest £11.7bn as part of its next five-year business plan, £2bn more than in the previous period. It includes £2.1bn to reduce leakage and improve the resilience of its infrastructure, including the building of a storage reservoir in Oxfordshire. The company, however, said that average bills would stay flat in real terms over the five-year period even as several of its peers promised to cut prices for their customers.

Thames Water has been a lightning rod for criticism of the industry, which has been accused of piling up debt and failing on maintenance while rewarding shareholders through hefty dividend payments. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, in March attacked the industry’s [high rewards for executives](https://www.ft.com/content/fb6e49ba-1d58-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6). His comments came after sustained criticism from Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour party, who has threatened to renationalise the industry.

Britain’s 17 regional water monopolies submitted their five-year spending plans to Ofwat, the industry regulator, on Monday. [United Utilities](http://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=BBG000BBFLJ9) and [Severn Trent](http://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=BBG000BS5F15) said they would cut average bills by 10.5 per cent and 5 per cent respectively from 2020 while promising to invest in infrastructure in response to rising regulatory pressure to provide better service.

South West Water, which is owned by [Pennon Group](http://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=BBG000BZT267), said it would cut leakage by 15 per cent while keeping bills lower by 2025 than they were in 2010. It also plans to offer dividend-paying shares to its customers, a move that would mark the first return to partial public ownership of a water company in England since privatisation. Anglian Water said it would increase its bills by less than 1 per cent arguing its region faced specific challenges including rapid housing growth.

John Russell, senior director for strategy and planning at Ofwat, said the regulator would “pore over each and every business plan” and would look “for evidence that they are robust, ambitious and, crucially, that they have been shaped by customers”.

Steve Robertson, who took over as chief executive of Thames Water two years ago, defended the decision not to cut bills, insisting it had “not missed a trick”.

The company, he added, had engaged very closely with its customers. The message from them was that “the priority should be on service and on resilience”. Thames Water, he added, was starting with some of the lowest bills in the sector. The company, which serves ten of the poorest boroughs in the UK, will cut bills for households struggling to pay.

The investment programme, Mr Robertson said, had the full support of the company’s shareholders, now mainly pension schemes and sovereign wealth funds. Macquarie, the Australian infrastructure bank, [sold its final stake](https://www.ft.com/content/63ae6f88-08a5-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b) to Canadian pension fund Omers and the Kuwait Investment Authority in March last year. Thames Water on Monday said it would limit annual external payouts to shareholders at about £20m and reduce its level of gearing — the ratio of net debt to its regulatory capital value — to 76.2 per cent, down from about 81 per cent last year.

All of his investors, said Mr Robertson, were “totally on board” with the plan and were “clearly prioritising investment in the infrastructure and fixing things that need to be fixed above short-term yield”.

“It is a very sensible investment strategy when they look at their 30-40 year horizons,” he added.

As part of its investment programme Thames Water wants to build a storage reservoir near Abingdon in Oxfordshire which would be connected to the Thames. Mr Robertson said the reservoir would cost about £2bn-£2.5bn to construct and could take up to 15 years to complete. It will capture excess rainfall during the winter and then be able to release it to the wider region during hotter months at times of need.

“The economic impact of a major drought in London is phenomenal. It would pay for itself in a few days,” said Mr Robertson.
