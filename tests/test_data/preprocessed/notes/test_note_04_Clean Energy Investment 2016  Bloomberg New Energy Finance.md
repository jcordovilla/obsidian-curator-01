## What the Data Shows

The latest BNEF figures show dollar investment globally falling in 2016 in dollar terms, with bright spots in offshore wind and acquisition activity. What’s new?

### 1\. Overall Investment Falls by 18%.

New investment in clean energy fell to $287.5bn in 2016, 18% lower than the record investment of $348.5bn in 2015 and 9% lower than the $315bn invested in 2014.

### 2\. Equipment Costs Keep Falling Too.

The 2016 setback in global investment partly reflected sharp falls in equipment prices: cost-competitiveness improvements in solar and wind power mean that more megawatts can be installed for the same price.

### 3\. China and Japan Cool Down.

After years of record-breaking investment, the two countries cut back on building new large-scale projects and shifted towards digesting the capacity they have already put in place.

### 4\. Offshore Wind Heats Up.

Capital spending commitments hit $29.9bn in 2016, up 40% on the previous year, as developers in Europe and China took advantage of bigger turbines and improved economics.

### 5\. Acquisitions in Clean Energy Break the $100bn Level.

This totaled $117.5bn in 2016, up from $97bn in 2015. Behind this surge were a rise in renewable energy project acquisitions to $72.7bn, but particularly a leap in corporate M&A to a record $33bn.
