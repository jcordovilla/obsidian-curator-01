Transport minister Chris Grayling believes using Virgin, Southern and other private firms will lead to savings, sources say. According to the Telegraph, Grayling is considering introducing a “vertical integration” that would hand more control to those private firms over what repairs are done on the lines on which they operate and when they take place.It was reported that the changes would come into effect as new franchises were awarded.

The rail network's structure dates from 1996 when John Major’s government sold off British Rail and put a new private company, Railtrack, in charge of the rail network.However, Railtrack collapsed in 2001, prompting a major political row when Stephen Byers, then the Labour transport secretary, said its private shareholders would not be compensated. Network Rail, which is 100 per cent owned by the taxpayer, was set up by the government to replace Railtrack with a £300 million of public money. Network Rail has come under scrutiny since being effectively renationalised in August last year, shifting its £37.8bn debt pile to the government’s balance sheet. The reclassification was the result of an EU edict.

**_Network Rail está sometido permanentemente a crítica pero los británicos renuevan personas  e ideas y aparentemente la Dirección es muy profesional no politizada a pesar de que la política está presente en Network Rail. Incluyo los tres       C-Suit pero los otros 9 consejeros tal para cual._**

**_Sobre regulación : ORR is a non-ministerial government department with around 280 staff and a budget of about £30m each year. We are funded by the rail industry for our Rail Regulation role and our Highways function is funded by the Department for Transport._**
